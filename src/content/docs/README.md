## Philosophy

- Keep dependencies amount at a minimum
- Keep a tight feature scope
- Avoid sneaking "magic" features
- Avoid patching platform APIs
- Avoid bundler-tied APIs
- Preserve a stable and minimal API surface
- Encourage browser native capabilities usage
<!-- - Provide useful helpers for a beginner experience -->

All of these are **faithful goals**, not **immutable dogmas**.
