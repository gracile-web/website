# Introduction

Welcome to the Gracile web framework documentation!

Gracile is a thin, full-stack, **web** framework with:

- Portable **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS**, thanks to **Lit (SSR)**.
- High responsivity during dev. and build, thanks to **Vite**.
- A **minimal dependency footprint** for its **runtime** and your **distributable**.
- Web standards friendliness, like **Custom Elements** (aka Web Components) or the **WhatWG Fetch** API.
- A streamlined **D**eveloper e**X**perience for building, instead of fiddling around.

## Main features

Gracile is powered by **Vite** and **Lit SSR**.  
It's pretty low-scope, agnostic and can adapt easily to a variety of tech stacks.

With it, you can achieve:

- File-based routing with efficient code-splitting
- **S**erver **S**ide **R**endering
- **S**tatic **S**ite **G**eneration
- **Server** integration (`Request`/`Response`) for **Express**, **Hono**‚Ä¶
- Full-stack **Custom Elements** (Lit), with hydration
- **Content** websites
- Multi or Single Page **Applications**
- Progressive enhancements (no JS fallbacks, smart hydration‚Ä¶)
- And more, via **Add-ons** (Markdown, Metadata, SVG‚Ä¶)

All that, with a **few conventions**, a **standard-oriented** approach and a very **contained footprint** ü§è.

Web Components, TypeScript, SASS, Lit, and other DX perks are all at your fingertips; while remaining optional.

Thanks to the Vite modular architecture, and Node.js versatility, **developer experience** is smoothed up
across the board: in **development** and for **production**.

<!-- ## Philosophy

- Keep dependencies amount at a minimum
- Keep a tight feature scope
- Avoid sneaking "magic" features
- Avoid patching platform APIs
- Avoid bundler-tied APIs
- Preserve a stable and minimal API surface
- Encourage browser native capabilities usage -->

<!-- - Provide useful helpers for a beginner experience -->

<!-- All of these are **faithful goals**, not **immutable dogmas**. -->
